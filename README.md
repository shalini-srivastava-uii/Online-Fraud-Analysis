By analyzing these graphical representations, we can gain valuable insights into the transaction data and identify potential trends, patterns, and anomalies related to fraudulent activity. These insights can inform the development of effective fraud detection strategies and mitigation measures.

Bar Chart (Step vs. Frequency):

The bar chart displays the distribution of transactions across different steps. Each step represents a specific time period or stage in the transaction process. From the chart, we can observe the frequency of transactions occurring at each step, which provides insights into transaction patterns over time.
Box Chart (Amount vs. Type):

The box chart presents the distribution of transaction amounts based on transaction types. By comparing the box plots for different transaction types, we can analyze the central tendency, spread, and presence of outliers in transaction amounts. This helps in understanding the variability in transaction amounts across different transaction types.
Pie Chart (IsFraud Distribution):

The pie chart illustrates the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. It provides a visual representation of the proportion of fraudulent transactions relative to the total number of transactions. This enables us to understand the prevalence of fraud within the dataset.
Violin Plot (Amount Distribution):

The violin plot depicts the distribution of transaction amounts. It provides insights into the spread and shape of the distribution, including any skewness or multimodality. By comparing the violin plots for fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, we can identify differences in the distribution patterns of transaction amounts between the two categories.
Bar Plot (Type vs. Frequency):

The bar plot showcases the frequency of different transaction types. It allows us to compare the occurrence of each transaction type and understand their relative proportions within the dataset. This analysis helps in identifying the most common types of transactions.
Histogram Plot (Amount Distribution):

The histogram plot visualizes the distribution of transaction amounts. It provides a frequency distribution of transaction amounts, allowing us to identify the most common transaction amounts and detect any outliers or unusual patterns. This helps in understanding the overall distribution of transaction amounts within the dataset.
